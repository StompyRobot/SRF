/*************************************************************
 *           Unity Object Pool (c) by ClockStone 2011        *
 * 
 * Allows to "pool" prefab objects to avoid large number of
 * Instantiate() calls.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 
 * Add the PoolableObject script component to the prefab to be pooled.
 * You can set the maximum number of objects to be be stored in the 
 * pool from within the inspector.
 * 
 * Replace all Instantiate( myPrefab ) calls with 
 * ObjectPoolController.Instantiate( myPrefab)
 * 
 * Replace all Destroy( myObjectInstance ) calls with 
 * ObjectPoolController.Destroy( myObjectInstance )
 * 
 * Note that Awake(), and OnDestroy() get called correctly for 
 * pooled objects. However, make sure that all component data that could  
 * possibly get changed during its lifetime get reinitialized by the
 * Awake() function.
 * The Start() function gets also called, but just after the Awake() function
 * during ObjectPoolController.Instantiate(...)
 * 
 * If a poolable objects gets parented to none-poolable object, the parent must
 * be destroyed using ObjectPoolController.Destroy( ... )
 * 
 * Be aware that OnDestroy() will get called multiple times: 
 *   a) the time ObjectPoolController.Destroy() is called when the object is added
 *      to the pool
 *   b) when the object really gets destroyed (e.g. if a new scene is loaded)
 *   
 * References to pooled objects will not change to null anymore once an object has 
 * been "destroyed" and moved to the pool. Use PoolableReference if you need such checks.
 *
