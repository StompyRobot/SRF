/*************************************************************
 *       Unity Audio Toolkit (c) by ClockStone 2013          *
 * 
 * Provides useful features for playing audio files in Unity:
 * 
 *  - ease of use: play audio files with a simple static function call, creation 
 *    of required AudioSource objects is handled automatically 
 *  - conveniently define audio assets in categories
 *  - play audios from within the inspector
 *  - set properties such as the volume for the entire category
 *  - change the volume of all playing audio objects within a category at any time
 *  - define alternative audio clips that get played with a specified 
 *    probability or order
 *  - advanced audio pick modes such as "RandomNotSameTwice", "TwoSimultaneously", etc.
 *  - uses audio object pools for optimized performance particularly on mobile devices
 *  - set audio playing parameters conveniently, such as: 
 *      + random pitch & volume
 *      + minimum time difference between play calls
 *      + delay
 *      + looping
 *  - fade out / in 
 *  - special functions for music including cross-fading 
 *  - music track playlist management with shuffle, loop, etc.
 *  - delegate event call if audio was completely played
 *  - audio event log
 *  - audio overview window
 * 
 * 
 * Usage:
 *  - create a unique GameObject named "AudioController" with the 
 *    AudioController script component added
 *  - Create an AudioObject prefab containing the following components: Unity's AudioSource, the AudioObject script, 
 *    and the PoolableObject script (if pooling is wanted). 
 *    Then set your custom AudioSource parameters in this prefab. Next, specify your custom prefab in the AudioController as 
 *    the "audio object".
 *  - create your audio categories in the AudioController using the Inspector, e.g. "Music", "SFX", etc.
 *  - for each audio to be played by a script create an 'audio item' with a unique name. 
 *  - specify any number of audio sub-items (= the AudioClip plus parameters) within an audio item. 
 *  - to play an audio item call the static function 
 *    AudioController.Play( "MyUniqueAudioItemName" )
 *  - Use AudioController.PlayMusic( "MusicAudioItemName" ) to play music. This function assures that only 
 *    one music file is played at a time and handles cross fading automatically according to the configuration
 *    in the AudioController instance
 *  - Note that when you are using pooling and attach an audio object to a parent object then make sure the parent 
 *    object gets deleted using ObjectPoolController.Destroy()
 *

/// <summary>
/// The audio managing class used to define and play audio items and categories.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// At least one instance of an AudioController must exist in each scene using the Audio Toolkit. Usually there is 
/// exactly one controller, but you can have additional controllers if they are marked as such (in the Unity insepector, see <see cref="isAdditionalAudioController"/>)
/// There a two options when setting up an AudioController. Either you can specify all audio files that are used in your
/// entire project in one single AudioController. Then add this AudioController to your initial scene and set 
/// it persistent from within the inspector, so it will survive when a new scene is loaded. This way all audios
/// are accessible from within your entire application. If you have a lot of audio files though, this may lead 
/// to a lengthy loading time and will have a rather large memory footprint. To avoid this, you can alternatively 
/// set up a specific AudioController for each scene which only contains those audio files needed in the particular 
/// scene.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// Once you have defined your audio categories and items in the Unity inspector you can play music and sound effects 
/// very easily:
/// <code>
/// AudioController.Play( "MySoundEffect1" );
/// AudioController.Play( "MySoundEffect2", new Vector3( posX, posY, posZ ) );
/// AudioController.PlayMusic( "MusicTrack1" );
/// AudioController.SetCategoryVolume( "Music", 0.5f );
/// AudioController.PauseMusic();
/// </code>
